Overview

Welcome to the capstone program! The capstone program is a two-quarter sequence (Fall 2025 and Winter 2026) in which you will be mentored by a faculty or industry expert(s) in their domain of expertise. By the end of Quarter 2, you will design and execute a project from that domain in teams of 2-4. You can see the projects from last year here, and from all prior years here.

At a high level, here’s how the capstone program is organized:

    In Quarter 1 (DSC 180A), you will gain background information in your chosen domain by working on a guided project (e.g. a paper replication) under the supervision of your mentor. By the end of Quarter 1, not only will you have you completed a guided project (your “Quarter 1 Project”), but you will write a proposal for a more independent project (known as the “Quarter 2 Project”, or the capstone project).
    In Quarter 2 (DSC 180B), you execute the Quarter 2 Project you proposed earlier in Quarter 1.

Throughout Quarter 1, there is also a “methodology” component that supplements your knowledge of your domain with best practices in software engineering, project management, and effective communication.
Quarter 1 (DSC 180A, Fall 2025)
Getting Started

Before the quarter begins:

    Confirm the date and time of your discussion section on the Enrollment, as it may have been updated since you last checked.
        Note that sections begin the week of Monday, September 29th You must attend your discussion section each week. Your mentors will mark attendance for discussion sessions and any loss of attendance will reflect on the participation grade.
        If your section is being held on Zoom, your mentor should reach out to you before your first section with the link. If you do not hear from your mentor before the quarter begins, reach out on your own. It is YOUR responsbility to get this set up with your mentor.
    Note that there is only one live lecture this quarter where I will go over the expectations and what you will be experiencing during these two quarters. Date and time TBA. All other methodology instruction will be provided asynchronously on this website.
    Make sure you can access the following sites; email the instructor if you can’t:
        Gradescope, where all assignments will be submitted.
        Piazza, the discussion forum we will use for methodology. All class-wide announcements will only be posted here!

Note that we will not be using Canvas at all this quarter.
Course Components

As mentioned in the Overview, the primary goal of Quarter 1 is to get you acquainted with your mentor’s domain. The main deliverable in Quarter 1 is the “Quarter 1 Project”, which you will work on gradually throughout the quarter by completing the tasks that your mentor assigns you. The Quarter 1 Project is due at the end of the quarter, but a checkpoint is due in early November to make sure you’re on track.

You will complete your Quarter 1 Project either individually or in groups, depending on your mentor’s preferences. Your Quarter 1 Project will serve as a foundation for your Quarter 2 Project Proposal, which you will submit by the end of the quarter. The Quarter 2 Project will be completed in groups of 2-4 starting during the winter and throughout Quarter 2.

Note: You may not get to choose who your “partners” are, as that may be up to your mentor; like in industry or academia, groups will be formed using a variety of factors, including academic background, mutual interests, and perhaps a little randomness.

The subsections below describe how the course operates.
Lecture (Methodology)

Lectures are focused on methodological skills that can apply to all domains. In lectures, we will cover best practices with software engineering for data science and project management (see the course homepage for a full listing in Quarter 1).

Based on feedback from prior iterations of the capstone, we’ve decided to deliver methodology lectures as lecture notes that you read outside of class and discuss with course staff during synchronous sessions. Specifically:

    Each Tuesday, we will post a “lesson” on the course homepage. A lesson will contain all of the methodology content you need to learn for the week. Read each lesson on your own. (We will make an announcement when we release new lessons).
    Many methodology lessons will have an accompanying “methodology assignment”, due the following Monday. See the Assignments section for more details.
    The methodology TAs will hold office hours throughout the week to answer any questions with methodology content (or even your domain work, for that matter).

Note that during week1, we will hold a “traditional” introductory lecture during the scheduled lecture slots, and you should plan to attend. The first methodology lesson will also be released during week 1.

We will not be using the “lab” component of the course that appears on WebReg, nor will we be using the “lecture” component after Week 1.
Discussion (Domain)

Each week, you will meet with your domain mentor for an hour in discussion section. You can see the time of your discussion meeting on the Enrollment page. Attendance in discussion section is mandatory, and you must notify your mentor in advance if you can’t make it in a particular week. Any unexplained absences will reflect on your grade for the quarter

Each week, your domain mentor will assign you a combination of readings and tasks to complete, along with “participation” questions to answer to ensure that you’ve engaged with the material. You must complete these participation questions 24 hours before discussion, as your responses to them will drive the class discussion. Your mentor may provide you with specific participation questions to answer; if not, you should answer these “default” participation questions. You should complete the other tasks they assign you before discussion as well, though you may not have to submit them anywhere. Later in the quarter, you will brainstorm project proposals in discussion as well.

Note that discussion section will consist of discussion, not lecture. As such, if you do not ask questions in discussion section, no discussion will occur. To get the most out of the capstone program, you should actively participate in discussion section. In the workplace, you will often need to communicate with your coworkers and ask questions when you don’t understand things, and the same is true here.
Office Hours

There are two flavors of office hours:

    Methodology office hours, held by the methodology (DSC 180A) course staff. Come to these office hours with questions on methodology lectures and assignments, and on how to apply methodology concepts to your domain work. See the Office Hours page on the course website for the schedule.
        Note that different TAs have expertise in different areas; see the Staff page for a listing on each TA’s area of expertise.
    Domain office hours, held by your domain mentor. Come to these office hours with questions on the readings or tasks your mentor assigned you or on your projects. Your mentor will tell you when these are.
        You will be required to attend your mentor’s office hours at least three times throughout the quarter.

Remark on How the Course is Split

As is common in data science, you will likely find yourself as a bridge between domain specialists and (computing) methodology specialists. In this course, it is totally normal if your domain mentors do not know specifics of your code(or even know the language you are coding in!). You will have access to help from both methodology experts (in office hours) and your domain mentor (in discussion section and office hours). As such, it is up to you to formulate your questions for the appropriate audience (methodology expert or domain expert) so that you can adequately communicate with them to solve the problems you are facing.
Assignments and Grades

The table below summarizes all the ways you will be assessed in Quarter 1.
Component	Description	Due	Weight	Grading Notes
Methodology assignments	Assignments that develop your software development and project management skills. Submitted individually.	There will be at least 5. If there are more than 5, only your highest 5 will be counted in your methodology grade.	20%	4% each
Participation questions (default questions or mentor-provided)	Weekly questions to keep you engaged with the material and to inform your mentor of class progress. Submitted individually.	Weekly, Sunday night or night before discussion by request of the mentor for their domain	5%	Graded for completeness by methodology TAs
Overall participation	Engaging in conversation in discussion section is important for success in the capstone; as such, your mentor will assign you an overall participation grade at the end of the quarter that the instructor will evaluate in light of your participation in instructor surveys before assigning a final grade	N/A	10%	Graded by mentors and the instructor
Quarter 1 Project	A chance to put together everything you’ve produced while learning about your domain. Submitted individually or in groups (up to mentor).	Week 6 (checkpoint), Week 10 (final submission)	50%	35%: reports, graded by mentors (checkpoint + final)

15%: code, graded by methodology TAs (checkpoint + final; graded to ensure best practices are followed)
Quarter 2 Project Proposal	Proposal for final capstone project. Submitted in groups.	Week 9	15%	Graded by both methodology TAs (elevator pitch) and domain mentors (schedule + write-up)

Note that the table contains links to assignment descriptions; the Quarter 1 Project and Quarter 2 Project Proposal details are tentative, and won’t be finalized until they are officially released. We will make Piazza announcements when these components are finalized.
General Rubric

In order to ensure consistent grading across such a diverse array of domains, we will utilize a coarse grading scheme with a clear rubric. This scheme will reflect broad checkpoints that you meet, and should help maintain focus on large, impactful things that you can improve on while reducing grading disagreements.

The grading scheme we will use for all assignments (other than for participation questions, which are pass/fail, and methodology assignments, which may have numerical scores) follows an A/B/C/F scale (without plus/minus), developed by Shannon Ellis:
Grade	Criteria
A (4.0)	Accomplishes the task accurately, completely, and clearly. Code is clear, effective, and efficient. Written component is concise, at the appropriate level, and correct. Oral component (when applicable) is effective and within the time limit.
B (3.0)	Accomplishes the task well, but lacks some completeness or clarity. Code runs but lacks some aspect of clarity, effectiveness, and or efficiency. Written component is logical and generally correct, but lacks either clarity or accuracy. Oral component (when applicable) is moderately effective and/or slightly outside the time window.
C (2.0)	The task is somewhat accomplished, but lacks significantly when it comes to completeness and clarity. Code present but does not accomplish the task up to the standards of a data science graduating senior. Written component lacks substantial clarity/correctness. Oral component (when applicable) significantly lacks effectiveness/clarity.
F (0.0)	The task largely remains unaccomplished. Code lacks completeness, structure, and is unclear. Written component lacks required information to understand the work done. Oral component (when applicable) is nonsensical/unclear.
Letter Grades

Individual assignments will be graded on the A/B/C/F scale above, and your overall course grade will be determined by using the proportions listed at the start of this section. For the purposes of computing your course grade, A, B, C, and F map to 4, 3, 2, and 0. So for instance, if you earn:

    full credit (A) on methodology assignments,
    an A on participation questions,
    a B on participation (as graded by your mentor),
    an A on your Quarter 1 Project, and
    a B on your Quarter 2 Project Proposal,

your “numerical” grade would be 0.1⋅4+0.05⋅4+0.05⋅3+0.65⋅4+0.15⋅3=3.8.

You are guaranteed to earn at least the letter grade that your numerical grade converts to. For instance, a 3.7 is guaranteed to learn at least an A-, and a 2.0 is guaranteed to earn at least a C. When your numerical grade is between two letter grades, you are guaranteed to earn at least the lower letter grade; for instance, 3.8 is between 3.7 (A-) and 4.0 (A), so a 3.8 is guaranteed to learn at least an A-.

Note that at the end of Fall 2025 you will receive a grade in DSC 180A, and at the end of Winter 2026 you will receive a grade in DSC 180B; these are two separate courses, each worth 4 units.

With all of that said, in this course, you should not worry about your letter grade. The grades you receive on individual components of the course are meant to provide you with feedback on how to improve future submissions. To be successful in this course, you should strive to have engaging interactions with your domain mentor and to produce work that you are proud of. Nobody will remember whether you got an A- or a B in the capstone, but they will remember if you produce a stellar final project.
Quarter 2 (DSC 180B, Winter 2026)

In Quarter 2, you will execute your Quarter 2 Project, the proposal for which you submitted at the end of Quarter 1. You will also prepare to present your work to a variety of audiences, in a variety of formats (most notably, as a poster at our in-person capstone showcase on Friday, March 13th).
Getting Started

A few things to note before the quarter begins:

    Sections begin during Week 1 (note there isn’t a week 0 for the winter quarter). Confirm the modality, venue if applicable, date and time of your discussion section with your mentor.
        Make sure to enroll in your section ASAP if you haven’t already, and to start participating from Day 1.
    There are no new methodology lessons or assignments in Quarter 2. Everything you’ll be required to submit will be in some way related to your Quarter 2 Project, and all deadlines are on the course homepage. There are, however, Office Hours held by the methodology TAs each week.
    Make sure you can access the following sites; email the instructor if you can’t:
        The new WI 2026 Gradescope, where all assignments will be submitted.
        We will use the same Piazza instance as we did in the fall. All class-wide announcements will be sent here!

Course Components
Lecture (Methodology)

There are no new methodology lessons or assignments this quarter; all relevant material was already presented and assessed in Quarter 1. Throughout this quarter, you should refer back to the relevant methodology content from last quarter.

As was the case last quarter, there are no live lectures either except for one at the start of the Quarter.
Discussion (Domain)

As in Quarter 1, discussion section will focus on your domain. Each week, a representative from each group will give a “weekly check-in,” in which they present their group’s work over the past week to the rest of the domain.

The weekly check-in gives you an opportunity to practice talking about technical material, solicit feedback from your mentor, and learn from other teams’ successes and obstacles. As such, attendance in discussion each week is mandatory, like in Quarter 1. If you’re unable to attend in a given week, work out an arrangement with your mentor in advance.

With that all said, you’re expected to meet with your group at least once per week outside of your discussion section. To make sure that all group members are on track, we’ll have you create a running Google Doc in which your group details who did what each week, and submit a snapshot of it each Sunday by 11:59PM. This constitutes the Participation assignment this quarter. In addition, you will also need to meet your TAs every week to explain progress and ensure that EACH member has contributed to the project. The onus is on YOU to set up a weekly appointment with your TA. All members MUST be present. These meetings may happen online.
Office Hours

In addition to any office hours your mentor may hold, TAs will also hold office hours to help you resolve technical problems with your deliverables. See the Office Hours page for the schedule. Your TA will remain the same througout the quarter.
Assignments and Grades

See Quarter 2 Project spec for a description of all project deliverables, and the course homepage for all due dates.

Note: These weights may change slightly during the first two weeks of the quarter.
Component	Description	Weight
Checkpoints	Each component of the Quarter 2 Project has a checkpoint to ensure that you’re on track.	10%
Project Deliverable	If your project is a traditional methods or analysis project, your primary deliverable is your report.

If your project is building a product (e.g. an application or dashboard), your primary deliverable is your product itself which needs to be demonstrated to the TAs and mentors. However, a report is required to be submitted by all and is the entity that is graded formally. See the Quarter 2 Project spec for more details.	40%
Project Website	Each team will have to put together a website describing your project in detail. For those building a product, this product should be accessible from the website.	7.5%
Poster presentation	Your produced poster and presentations at the in-person capstone showcase will be graded on polish and clarity.	10%
Code artifact	Your final code submission will be graded based on the methodological standards introduced in Lesson 3 of Quarter 1.	7.5%
Ethics Assignments	Answering questions about ethics issues in your project and societal impacts	5%
Participation	Weekly prompts that require you to document each group member’s progress so far and how your project plans have evolved and presenting them satisfactorily to your TA	15%
Overall participation	As in Quarter 1, your mentor will assign you an overall participation grade at the end of the quarter.	5%
Grading Policy

Unless otherwise stated, we will follow the same General Rubric as in Quarter 1. We’ll also follow the same policy on Letter Grades. Note: your grade in DSC 180B is completely independent of your grade in DSC 180A.
Collaboration Policy and Academic Integrity

Refer to the Collaboration Policy and Academic Integrity from Quarter 1.
Collaboration Policy and Academic Integrity

In DSC 180, we expect you to work hard and engage with material that originates outside the academic walls. All ideas and work must be your own, that of your approved group, or properly cited. Act with integrity and don’t cheat.

In DSC 180 you are encouraged to use outside resources to help with your work. However, you must properly cite any concepts, writing, or code that originates from other sources. If you are unsure of whether something needs a citation, it’s best to:

    consult the domain expert for your section,
    follow the examples in course readings, and
    place citations with relevant links in comments.

The following activities are considered cheating and ARE NOT ALLOWED in DSC 180 (this is not an exhaustive list):

    Using or submitting either writing or code acquired from other students (except your group, where allowed).
    Not properly citing ideas, writing, or code acquired from outside sources. (Citations are a good thing!)
    Having any other student complete any part of an assignment on your behalf.
    Completing an assignment on behalf of someone else.

The following activities are examples of appropriate collaboration and ARE ALLOWED in DSC 180:

    Discussing the general approach to understanding or solving a problem.
    Talking about debugging/cleaning strategies or issues you ran into and how you solved them.
    Using outside material with proper citations (including StackOverflow code!).

Generative Artificial Intellience tools should not be used on any methodology assignments. As for your domain work (e.g. your weekly tasks, Quarter 1 Project, and Quarter 2 Project Proposal), whether and how you can use Generative AI is up to your mentor. Ask them!

📝 Report – Quarter 2 Project

🔙 to the main Quarter 2 Project page

    Checkpoint due Sunday, February 15th
    Final submission due Sunday, March 8th
    Graded by mentors

Your report should introduce and contextualize the problem you worked on, describe the methods used, state the results, and draw conclusions about the results. It should follow best practices in scientific writing, as laid out in Lesson 4. Note that if you’re building some sort of product, your report may look less like a traditional scientific paper and more like a ROI analysis of your product, and that’s fine – just make sure that early on, you’re clear on what your mentor’s expectations of your report are. Either way, all groups must write a paper.
A worthwhile Twitter thread to read.

As in Quarter 1, your report will need to be written in LaTeX, using the LaTeX template on Overleaf linked below. Submissions not using this template or LaTeX will NOT receive a grade.

Access the LaTeX template on Overleaf here.

Both the above template and the guidelines from Lesson 4 will provide you with suggested headings for your report, but it’s ultimately up to your mentor as to how they’d like you to organize your report.

Tip: The figures in your report should not be created from screenshots:

    Tables should be imported from CSVs.
    Plots should be saved programmatically (e.g. using plt.savefig) and imported (or converted from a notebook).

    Checkpoint (due Sunday, February 15th)

    The purpose of your report checkpoint is an opportunity to get feedback from your mentor. For your checkpoint, submit a PDF containing a draft of your report, with:

        Headings for every section you plan to write (e.g. “Introduction”, “Methods”, “Results”, “Conclusion”, “Appendix”, “Contributions”). This will make it easy to fill in the remaining sections later.
        A complete title, abstract, and introduction. You can reuse most of this from earlier work – say, your proposal or Quarter 1 Project report.
        A mostly complete methods section – you should know what your methods are at this point!
        An appendix section at the end that includes a copy of your latest project proposal for reference.
        A contributions section at the end that details the tasks that each group member was responsible for so far.

    Your checkpoint report should also be written in the aforementioned LaTeX template.

💻 Code – Quarter 2 Project

🔙 to the main Quarter 2 Project page

    Checkpoint due Sunday, February 15th
    Final submission due Sunday, March 8th
    Graded by your TA

Your code artifact is a public GitHub repository that contains all code for building/reproducing your project. It should follow best practices for data science software development, as discussed in Lesson 3. As was the case in Quarter 1, our primary ask is that your code is reproducible — that is, your repository should contain a README that describes exactly how someone should be able to run your code, in the same environment you used to create it. Don’t let this be you!

Your public GitHub repo should be updated incrementally and regularly to reflect your most recent work. Both at the checkpoint and at the end of the quarter, the commit history for your repo should show that each group member pushed code to the repo in regular intervals, not that all code was added right before the deadline – that’ll raise red flags 🚩. You may want to review Lesson 6 for pointers on how to collaborate with Git.

    Checkpoint (due Sunday, February 15th)

    The purpose of the code checkpoint is to verify that your code:

        Is well documented and build instructions are found in README.md. In particular, there need to be instructions on how to recreate the environment used to develop the code, e.g. how to create the necessary conda environment or Docker image.
        Is structured logically (e.g. uses build scripts, has library code in .py files rather than in notebooks, etc.)

🛜 Website – Quarter 2 Project

🔙 to the main Quarter 2 Project page

    Checkpoint due Sunday, February 22nd
    Final submission due Sunday, March 8th
    Graded by your TA

Overview

You will create a static website that serves as a public-facing version of your report. To get a sense of the types of websites students created in the past, refer to last year’s project websites.

Anyone on the internet may stumble across your website, whether that’s a recruiter that messages you on LinkedIn, your friends and family from home, someone on the internet who Googles your research area, or even an expert who is interested in your results. As such, your website should be targeted towards a general audience. Not everyone needs to know the details of your work immediately; instead, the goal of your website should be to get the general public interested in your project and why it is impactful, and to encourage them to read further if interested. Realistically, nobody is going to read your report or look at the code in your GitHub repository – both of which should be linked from your website – unless they have a good reason to.

Your website will be the most prominent and public-facing of all the deliverables you create. As such, you should strive to create a high-quality website that you and your mentor are proud of. Prior instructors tell us that hiring managers for industry jobs are more likely to respond to candidates who include links to project websites on their resumes!

When creating your website, you may certainly borrow material from your report, but you should reduce the amount of material and make stylistic changes to make it appropriate for a general audience. With that said, your site will contain many of the same sections as your report – expect your site to contain an introduction, a methods section, a results section, and a conclusion section.

    The introduction section should motivate the problem being addressed and justify its relevance to the reader. It should also introduce the methods being used.
    The methods section should describe how you approached the problem. The level of detail provided depends on the target audience.
    The results and conclusion sections (perhaps even just one big section in the website) should talk about the impact of the work.

You can tailor your website for different audiences by hiding in-depth technical details behind links or dropdown menus, like the one below.
Example dropdown

Note that your website should be simple and easy to navigate!

    Refrain from using complicated layouts and too many pages - readers like to scroll, not click. All you’re trying to do is motivate your project.
    Pictures and plots should tell your whole story, just like in your poster – just by skimming your figures, readers should be able to get the main idea of what you’ve done.
    It’s a good idea to review what you did in DSC 106.

You don’t need to write everything from scratch – feel free to re-use material from your report. However, your website should feel more informal and welcoming than your report, and so you may need to tailor your language and explanations accordingly.
Requirements

Unless you ask the instructor for explicit permission otherwise, your website should be hosted on GitHub Pages. Fortunately, you learned how to create websites on GitHub pages – you had to create one in Methodology Assignment 5 last quarter!

In some special cases, your group may be working on developing a “product”, like a dashboard, an application, or some sort of service. If that’s the case, you will create and submit both:

    Your actual product.
    A separate, static website that explains your project, according to the guidelines above. This is the way most people will acquaint themselves with your project. You should include a prominent link to your interactive webpage from your static page.

Primary vs. Secondary Deliverables
If your project is a traditional methods or analysis project, your primary deliverable is your report and your secondary deliverable is your website.

If your project is building a product (e.g. an application or dashboard), your primary deliverable is your product itself and your secondary deliverable is your report, though as mentioned above, you must still produce a static webpage, and it is that webpage that you should submit a checkpoint for.

    Checkpoint (due Sunday, February 23rd)

    All that’s required for the checkpoint is that you set up the skeleton/outline of your project webpage. It should contain titles and headers, but doesn’t need to contain content – all we need to see is that you put thought into how your webpage is organized.

    To submit the checkpoint, you’ll submit a link to the repository containing the code to your website (not the link to your website itself). The README.md in that code repository should contain a link to the website itself, which we can use to visit your page. Your TA will review your website with you in during Week 8 or 9.


You’ll need to start by creating an artifacts repository.

        Checkpoint and Submission

Overview

The capstone showcase on Friday, March 13th will be a poster session, which means you will present your project using a poster. During your assigned block, you and your group will stand next to your poster as attendees approach you to ask and hear about your work.

If you’ve never seen a poster session before, you can see footage of the 2018 CSE Internship Symposium poster session below.

And here’s a picture of an older capstone showcase (which was the first in-person capstone showcase):

That’ll be you soon!
Conversations

At the poster session, when someone approaches you and your poster, the first question you can expect them to ask is

    So, what’s your project about?

To answer their question, you’ll give a short, well-rehearsed elevator pitch that introduces your project, the context in which it lies, and its impact. As a reminder, attendees at the capstone showcase will come from a variety of backgrounds:

    Fellow capstone students.
    Other UCSD students (some data science, some not).
    Faculty mentors.
    Industry mentors.

As such, the elevator pitch you start with should be general enough so that all audiences will be able to understand the core elements of your work just by listening to it. As you did for the elevator pitch you recorded in Quarter 1, you should structure your elevator pitch as follows:

    Context: Tell the audience what you are going to tell them – tell them why they should care.
    Content: Tell them about your approach and results.
    Conclusion: Recap your content, and how it is relevant with regards to the context you provided at the start.

Keep your elevator pitch short, no more than 2 minutes long. This is so that, after hearing your elevator pitch, attendees have time to ask questions to hear more about the parts of your project that interest them, before they walk away to another project. While your elevator pitch will be general, you should be prepared to answer questions that involve varying levels of detail; a first-year data science major in DSC 10 will ask different questions than a data science professor who is mentoring other groups will.
Preparation

The first key to success is rehearsing your elevator pitch. You’ll be required to do this with your mentor in section, and with TAs in Week 8. But you’ll need to practice much, much more than twice – in the weeks leading up to the showcase, plan to practice your elevator pitch repeatedly with friends and family of a variety of academic backgrounds. No matter how confident you are in your presentation skills, practice, practice, practice!

When practicing your elevator pitch, you may find it useful to use slides to structure your presentation (though, of course, you will not be able to actually present the slides at the poster session). We suggested this approach in the Quarter 2 Proposal Elevator Pitch assignment in Quarter 1. Ultimately, though, you’ll need to be able to deliver your elevator pitch without referring to notes of any kind. Sure, you’ll have your poster, but while you’re speaking, your poster should serve as a visual aid that contains visualizations and summaries of key results. You can point to various figures and sections of your poster, but make sure you are not simply reading off your poster – that’s not engaging.

The best way to prepare for the questions you’ll receive at the showcase is to let your audiences during your practice runs ask questions, and come up with answers to all of them. This is why it’s important to practice giving your pitch to different audiences – different audiences will be curious about different aspects of your project and will require different levels of detail to be satisfied. As we said in the Quarter 2 Proposal Elevator Pitch guidelines, make sure that you can turn your pitch into a conversation if someone asks a question in the middle.
Checkpoint and Submission

    Presentation Checkpoint (given during your Week 8 Check-In)

    In Week 8, you will make an appointment with your TA to practice giving presentations about your project using your poster. Signups will be released in Week 7.

At the capstone showcase itself, your TA will come to your table and grade your final presentation, while your mentor will grade your final poster. The rubric that TAs will use to grade your oral presentation at the showcase is as follows.

Each of the six bullet points below are worth 1 point.

    Introduced the domain to a general audience.
    Explained why the domain is interesting to a general audience.
    Described the specific problem being approached in sufficient detail.
    Described the methods used in sufficient detail.
    Described the results of the project in sufficient detail.
    Described the impact of the project’s results to a general audience.

Letter Grade	Points
A	4
B	3
C	2
F	0

Note that these don’t all have to be touched on in your “elevator pitch”; they can be revealed in the conversations you have with your TA / other attendees. With that said, all group members will receive an individual presentation grade – so all group members need to be able to talk and answer questions about the project at the showcase.
Posters
Requirements

From the UC Davis Undergraduate Research Center:

    At a poster session, your ultimate goal is to share the story of your work with as many people as possible. This will give you the opportunity to network with people that may be future advisers, employers, or collaborators and you can receive important feedback on your work. To bring people in, your poster should communicate the topic quickly and include visual elements such as pictures, graphs, maps and diagrams as well as text. At its core, an effective poster is centered on a concise and powerful story. With the help of visuals, the presenter can share the story of the work in just five minutes.

Your poster will primarily serve as a visual aid as you present your work. It must contain:

    A prominent, informative title, that immediately tells the viewer what the project is about. (This should be the same as the title of your paper; if you haven’t thought about what this will be, now is as good of a time as any.)
    The names and emails for all group members, including your mentor, directly underneath the title of your poster. Your mentor’s name should always appear last. See more in Branding.
    One section for each section of your report, in which the key points are summarized as short bullet points and in tables and graphs where possible.
        You can include an acknowledgements section, but it shouldn’t be longer than two sentences.
        Only include the references that are directly relevant for the material on the poster (should only be 2-3 max); don’t include your entire bibliography.
    A single QR code that links to your project website. Your project website should itself have links to your report and GitHub repository.

Additionally:

    Your poster will ultimately be submitted as a PDF of size 48” x 36”.
    Make sure that all text and figures on your poster are large and legible – to do this, ensure that your figures are exported at a resolution of 300 DPI (dots per inch). See here for some guidelines. As is mentioned below, you’re free to use any software you’d like to edit your poster, but you should frequently export it as a PDF and zoom in to make sure all figures are high quality.

**While we won’t enforce a particular poster template, we do ask that you follow the above guidelines carefully. Last year, many groups didn’t include emails or their mentor’s names.

While the focus should be on visuals, your poster should also be self-contained – just by looking at your poster, someone should be able to understand the main idea behind your project, the context in which it exists, and its impact, without you having to be present. After all, your poster may eventually be hung up in the hallway of the new HDSI building – passerbys looking at your poster should be able to understand what you did.
Poster Design

For actually creating your poster, you’re free to use any tools you’d like, though two common choices are LaTeX and Google Slides/Powerpoint. You’ll find templates in all sorts of formats online. For one, Kengchi Chang (a methodology TA) has provided links to two LaTeX templates he has used; Example 1 looks like this:

Start early. Figure out what content you’d like to put on your poster, and then try and find a template (or create your own) that works for your content.
Branding

This section is new: it was only added on February 21st. Make sure to read it carefully!

Some requirements:

    The names and emails of all group members, including your mentor, should appear at the top of your poster, directly underneath the title of your poster. Your mentor’s name should always appear last.
        Many checkpoint submissions didn’t follow this rule!
        Make sure individuals’ emails appear directly underneath their names, rather than somewhere else on the page.
        For your mentor’s name, you should put “Mentor:” before their name, e.g. “Mentor: Umesh Bellur” (and then underneath that, ubellur@ucsd.edu).
        Since we’re including the HDSI logo (see below), there’s no need to separately write “Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute.”
    You must place one of the following two HDSI logos in the top right corner of your poster:

Option 1: Blue and Gold (download high-res version here)



Option 2: White (download high-res version here)
Yes, this is intentionally hard to see on a white background – only use this logo if the top of your poster is a dark color!

Here’s a barebones example of a poster that follows the branding and formatting requirements exactly:

If you’re working with an industry partner, ask your mentor if they want their company’s logo to be on the poster. If they say they’d like it to be, then either put their logo to the right of the HDSI one, or in the top left corner of the poster – it’s up to you.
Guidance

We won’t reinvent the wheel here – there is a wealth of resources available online that you can consult for guidance on how to produce a poster. Your mentor is also a valuable resource – they’ve almost certainly created a poster before, and ultimately they will be the ones grading your poster.

Start by reading the following articles.

    Haq, Making the most of your conference poster. This set of slides clearly describe what the purpose of a scientific poster is and how to structure one.
    Alley, Scientific Posters. A good, quick page to read to understand the purpose of a scientific poster, with examples.
    Ellis, Data Science Presentations. Not all of the content in these slides are directly applicable, since you’re not creating slides, but many of the examples towards the end of how to produce effective visualizations are directly relevant, since much of your poster will consist of visuals.
    NeuroWire, Tips for presenting your scientific poster at a conference. An excellent article that details what the role of your poster is in your overall presentation, and how to prepare for the poster session more generally.

Then, consult the following links for additional guidance.

Templates:

    Overleaf has a large library of ready-to-go LaTeX templates.
    Nathaniel Johnston’s LaTeX Poster Template.

Examples:

    UC Davis Academic Posters. This is a gallery of posters created by undergraduate student researchers at UC Davis.
    UCSD CSE Internship Symposium 2021. Click around to see several examples of posters, though the examples you’ll see here fit a slightly different role (they aren’t tied to scientific papers). Many of the resources linked on this page are taken from here.

Guidelines:

    Hall, Fixing academic posters: the #BetterPoster approach. This poster template looks clean, but the design is quite radical – ask your mentor for their thoughts on this design.
        A related video: How to create a better research poster in less time.
    Cranor, Research Posters 101.


Checkpoint and Submission

    Poster Checkpoint (due Sunday, February 15th)

    For this checkpoint, all you need to do is submit a draft of your poster as a PDF. Your mentor will provide feedback on this draft.

Once again, you must place your print order with Triton Print for the poster by March 8th. Final submissions of the all capstone material will be due by March 8th 11.59pm

We will pay for the printing costs of your poster. Instructions have been posted on Piazza.

1️⃣ Quarter 1 Project

    The checkpoint is due on during the first week of November (Friday, Nov 7th). Read this page for what to expect in this checkpoint.
    The entire project is due during the last week of classes (Friday, Dec 5th).

You will submit both the code and reports you generate for both the checkpoint and final submission to Gradescope. You may work on your Quarter 1 Project individually or in a group of up to 4. If you’re working in a group, you should submit everything to Gradescope as a group. Multiple submissions by members of the team will result in a penalty.
Overview

This quarter, under the guidance of your mentor, you’re working through a guided project (e.g. paper replication) that introduces you to the domain. By the end of the quarter, you will summarize the results of your work in a well-organized report that follows the norms of research papers in your domain.

Your work will go beyond mere paraprhasing existing work that you study:

    Your domain may be taking a broader or narrower view than the work of any one paper. Your report will reflect the work you are doing, not the broader research that may be found in the work being studied.
    You will likely be using data that differs from that used in the work you are studying.
    Your conclusions may be different than the work you are studying. You should present the conclusions drawn from your data/methods and address any discrepancies with the work being studied.
    The code supporting your work will conform to best practices in data science software development.

Deliverables

There are two deliverables, both of which have an associated checkpoint. Your final deliverables are graded according to this rubric.

    Report (Graded by your mentor)
    Code (Graded by your TA)

Report (Graded by your mentor)

The objectives for your report are described below.

    By carefully explaining work in your area, you’ll understand the area you’ll be working in very well, down to the details. In particular, this process will allow you to understand how to draw a rigorous conclusion in your domain.
    By emulating finished work in your domain, you’ll learn how to effectively communicate technical ideas in your domain.
    By using and critiquing existing methodologies and conclusions, you’ll devise possible improvements to these methodologies that you can use in your Quarter 2 Project.
    By working on the literature review, contained in the introduction section of your report, you’ll create a foundation for your Quarter 2 Project.
    By working on the report, you’ll gain practice with using tools (such as LaTeX, Markdown, and Jupyter Notebooks) for producing such reports.
    By writing code alongside your report, you’ll develop a library of useful code that can be used in your Quarter 2 Project.

You will submit your report as a PDF to Gradescope. Your final report will need to be written in LaTeX, using the LaTeX template on Overleaf linked below.

Access the LaTeX template on Overleaf here.

Both the above template and the guidelines from the methodology lessons will provide you with suggested headings for your report, but it’s ultimately up to your mentor as to how they’d like you to organize your report.

If you’re working on your Quarter 1 Project in a group, you’ll also need to submit a contributions statement, which we will release as a separate assignment on Gradescope towards the end of the quarter. There, for each member of your group, you’ll need to provide your best estimate for the amount of work they contributed to your Quarter 1 Project. For instance, if your group has 3 members, you may say something like “Person A: 40%, Person B: 30%, Person C: 30%.” If these statements contradict each other in a team, the instructor will decide individual grades based on interviews with team members.

Checkpoint
As your report checkpoint, you will submit the title, abstract, and introduction sections of your report. Note that your introduction itself will have three sections – an introductory paragraph, a literature review and discussion of prior work, and a description of relevant data. Intuitively, your checkpoint should contain a summary of the problem you are working on this quarter, with some context on why it’s interesting, along with anything your mentor wants you to include.
Code (Graded by your TA)

The code you write for your Quarter 1 Project must be stored in a public GitHub repository. The primary ask we have of your code is that it is reproducible. That is, in a file named README.md in your repo, you should provide detailed instructions on how others can run your code. It should describe:

    How to access and store the necessary data.
    The software dependencies needed to run the code. (In Lesson 8 (to come), we will cover various approaches, including conda environments and Docker.)
    The commands one needs to run to reproduce your results. (The methodology lessons will teach you how to create build scripts.)

In your Week 5 and Week 9/10 TA Check-Ins, your TA will go over your code and provide you with feedback on how it should be structured.

Checkpoint
As your code checkpoint, you’ll just submit a link to a GitHub repository containing any code you’ve already written.

💍 Quarter 2 Project Proposal

As you know, your main deliverable throughout the capstone sequence is your Quarter 2 Project. In order to ensure that you’ll be able to successfully execute your project, you’re required to submit a detailed proposal.

The proposal consists of three parts. The proposal is worth 15% of your DSC 180A grade; each component of the proposal is worth the same amount (5% of your DSC 180A grade). Below, we describe each component and its deliverables in more detail. The proposal is due during the last week of classes (Friday, Dec 5th).
Groups

Quarter 2 Projects must be worked on in groups; you may not work individually. You must submit your proposal with the same group that you’ll work on the project with. It is up to your mentor to determine how groups are formed; you should take the lead and ask them how groups will be formed. You’re required to sign up and attend the Week 8/9 TA Check-In in groups, so you should try and identify your group sooner rather than later.
Context

After this year, whether you work in industry or academia, you will often have to write project proposals.

    As a data scientist in industry, you’ll often have to write proposals to justify why your idea has value and is worth investigating.
    In academia, to receive any sort of funding, you’ll need to write a grant proposal, which reads similarly to a project proposal.

As such, you are required to write a project proposal here, not just to better plan your Quarter 2 Project, but to gain this valuable skill. You must write a proposal even if your mentor has already determined what your Quarter 2 Project is going to be.
Example Quarter 2 Projects

As you start to think about your Quarter 2 work, it’s a good idea to look at what students in your shoes last year were able to accomplish in the span of 10 weeks. Below, you’ll find some selected examples, though you can see all of last year’s projects at dsc-capstone.org/showcase-24, and all capstone projects ever at this sheet. You’ll learn more about the specific deliverables you’ll be required to produce in Quarter 2 in January; for now, just focus on the big picture.

Written Proposal (Graded by your mentor)
Description

The most important component of your proposal submission is a written proposal. Your written proposal should:

    State the problem being investigated, for both a general audience who knows nothing about your domain and a domain expert (like your mentor).
    Give the reader enough context to convince them the problem is interesting and worth investigating – if the project is executed, what will its impact be?
    Provide enough detail for a domain expert to understand whether the project’s goals are realistic to complete using the methods described and in the timeframe allocated.
    Specify the project’s primary output, e.g. a report/paper, a website, or an application. (Note that even if your primary output is a website, you will still have to write a paper, and vice versa.)

Like the Introduction section of a paper, presented in the methodology lesson, a written proposal should consist of three parts, that start broad and get increasingly narrower. In fact, you will reuse a lot of your written proposal when writing your Quarter 2 Project’s introduction section – and you may even see a lot of overlap between your written proposal and Quarter 1 Project report.

Specifically, your written proposal should have three sections:

    The context of the probem and why its worth solving and investing 10 weeks on the project. This should be accessible to anyone – for instance, methodology staff, your family and friends, and hiring managers for the jobs you apply to should all be able to read this and understand what you are proposing and why it matters.

    A narrow, carefully crafted problem statement for the domain expert. Precision is key and I highly encourage you to try and specify this mathematically. Has previous work attempted to answer these specific problems? If so, how did they fail? If not, why are these problems still interesting? In what way does your investigation address a deficiency in existing solutions? This section should be quite technical – make sure to refer to specific methods.

    A statement of the primary output (i.e., state whether you will create a report/paper, a website, or an application). If your project analyzes data, specify how you will communicate the analyses. If your project generates data, how will you analyze the data it produces?

In addition to the above structure, you need to outline what it will take for your project to be successful. In particular, if your project relies on data that was not used in the Quarter 1 Project, you need to prove the following:

    You can obtain the data.
    The data contains the information needed.
    The data is of sufficient quality and quantity.
    You have access to compute resources needed to process the data

The easiest way to do this is to actually obtain the data while writing the proposal and perform some preliminary analyses to ensure it will actually be able to help you accomplish your goals.

In years past, many groups fell in the trap of waiting until Quarter 2 to obtain their data, and by the time they realized that they either can’t obtain their data or that it won’t actually help them with their project, they had wasted a significant portion of the quarter. Don’t let this be you!
Working in Groups

Your proposal will form a contract for what you will work on and deliver in Quarter 2. You will have to work together and make decisions as a group, even if you may not fully agree with the choices. As you develop your proposal, consider the following:

    Try to agree on a general theme for what you want to investigate in your project.
    You do not need to have 100% agreement on the proposal, rather you need to be sure that the proposed area of investigation is interesting to you. The specifics of a proposal change as you work on it, and you may have to change direction while working on the project itself anyway.
    Discuss how your strengths might complement a teammate’s strengths. A proposal can consist of semi-independent pieces that fit individual team-member’s strengths – for instance, one student can be responsible for building and designing an ML model, another can be responsible for a statistical investigation into the data generated by the ML model, and another can be responsible for developing custom visualizations of the results. All of these would be too much for a single person to do well in a quarter, but they are all achievable when working in a group.

Just as you’re required to with your Quarter 1 Project, you’ll be required to submit a contributions statement along with your Quarter 2 Project at the end of Quarter 2. Last year, we saw several cases where a student in a group contributed a single-digit percentage of the overall work done by the project group, and those students’ scores suffered. One of the main purposes of the proposal is to avoid instances of this!
Ideation

As of the release of these specifications, you may not be sure what to propose for Quarter 2. That’s totally fine. To help you get started, part of your methodology assignments will have you brainstorm ideas based on your current understanding of your domain.

Note that the amount of freedom you have in proposing your own project will depend on your mentor. In fact, your mentor may already have determined what your Quarter 2 Project will be, and that’s fine. In any case, your mentor will play a crucial role in your proposal, as they’ll be able to help you come up with a plan that you can realistically execute in 10 weeks under their guidance. Your final proposal submission should not surprise them at any point, because you should be discussing it with them regularly and incorporating their feedback.
Deliverables and Grading

You’ll submit your written proposal as a PDF to Gradescope as a group. Like with your Quarter 1 Project, you must use our LaTeX template on Overleaf. Your mentor will grade your written proposal according to this rubric.

Access the LaTeX template on Overleaf here.
Schedule (Graded by your mentor)
Description

You’ll need to create a detailed plan of what you will do each week in order to execute your proposal and complete your Quarter 2 Project. Your proposed schedule should include:

    A 6-7 week schedule with tasks and goals to be accomplished each week by each person. This needs to be a matrix of people of one axis and time on another axis. Each cell contains the deliverable for that person for the week in question.
    A broad delineation of responsibilities among group members in the 6 week schedule.

By writing your schedule now, it’ll make it clear to both your group and your mentor whether your project can be realistically completed in the given timeframe. When creating your schedule, use your domain’s schedule and pace in Quarter 1 as a guide. What did you do each week? How much were you able to accomplish each week?

Note:

    Your schedules won’t be set in stone, as you will encounter hiccups along the way. However, by having a “contract” of who is going to do what, when, you’ll be able to hold everyone in your group accountable and will be able to help them if and when they get stuck.
    The amount of work you plan to do should scale with the size of your group. Groups of 4 should expect to accomplish more than a group of 2. It will be clear from your schedule whether your plan is too ambitious or not ambitious enough.
    DSC 180B – the capstone course you’ll be enrolled in next quarter – is a 4-unit course, meaning that you should expect to spend 12 hours per week on it on average. Plan for 11 of those hours to be spent on your project. Quality work takes time!

While working on your schedule, consult methodology lessons for tips on how to allocate tasks each week.
Frequently Asked Questions

Why a 6-7 week schedule in a 10 week quarter?

As mentioned above, not everything will go according to plan and you will face setbacks. By planning to take 6 weeks instead of 10, you’ll have some breathing room to deal with these setbacks.

    Once you complete your tasks, you’ll need to spend a lot of time polishing your work and making it presentable to a broad audience. Remember, you want to build something you’ll look back on in years from now and be proud of, not something you just threw together at the last minute.
    In the rare case that you finish everything you wanted to before the deadline, you’ll surely be able to pose new questions and add more tasks.

How specific should the tasks be?

As specific as possible.

    Others in your group (and your mentor) should be able to tell exactly what you’re working on by reading a task description in your proposal.
    The more specific the description, the better. One rule of thumb is that you should never have the same task listed across multiple weeks – if you do, the task is not specific enough! Don’t just say “EDA.”

How should we divide tasks up among group members?

Divide tasks so that they take advantage of the strengths of your group members and so that they can be parallelized. Don’t divide tasks so far that you have no idea what your partners are working on and are unable to help them!
Deliverables and Grading

You’ll submit your schedule as a PDF to Gradescope as a group. It will be separate from your written proposal PDF submission. We don’t have any special formatting instructions for your schedule, though one idea is to make a table in a Google doc with one row per week and one column per group member, and submit a PDF of the doc. Your mentor will grade your schedule according to this rubric.
Elevator Pitch (Graded by your TA)
Description

Finally, you’ll need to write and present an elevator pitch for your proposal. Your elevator pitch must be between 1 and 3 minutes long and should summarize the written proposal and its relevance for an audience that is not familiar with your domain. For instance, suppose you have a job interview in April and someone says “Hey, I saw you did a capstone project. Tell me about it!” You’d give them your elevator pitch.

Elevator pitches are purely verbal – that is, they should not have any accompanying graphics. They should include few implementation details, and instead focus on the problem statement, context, and motivation.

The typical anatomy of a short presentation is as follows:

    Context: What’s the background? Explain why this area is interesting.
    Complication: Tell us what solutions currently exist to the problem at hand, and where the “gaps” in current solutions are.
    Question: Clearly state the question that addresses the problem.
    Hypothesis: State your proposed solution. Propose a clear, quantifiable hypothesis that will advance our understanding.

This framework should sound familiar, and that’s because something similar is discussed in a methodology lesson. You may want to re-watch Professor Benjamin Smarr’s video as you start to write your elevator pitch.

Unlike the other components of the proposal, pitches will be delivered individually!
Examples

Here is a couple of elevator pitches from the previous cohort.

Quentin Callahan(direct link)
	
Nilay Menon(direct link)
Tips

Even though elevator pitches do not contain slides, it’s a good idea to use slides to help organize and prepare your pitch. Here’s one approach:

    Create 4-5 slides, each corresponding to a single idea (perhaps one slide for each of the four pieces above).
    Each slide should contain a title that is a statement of an idea, and a single drawing or explanation.
    Practice, practice, practice. When practicing:
        Talk through the ideas that each slide represent as if you’re explaining them to a listener.
        Each time you practice, try to vary the way you explain each idea.
        Over time, your reliance on the slides will decrease. However, do not write a script and memorize it; that’s not engaging.
        Practice giving the pitch to members of your group. Let them interrupt you with questions. Can you adapt your pitch into a conversation if people ask you questions in the middle? If so, you have a strong pitch.
        Stand up, speak slowly, and enunciate!

Deliverables and Grading

You’ll present your elevator pitch in two stages:

    First, you’ll deliver a dry run of your elevator pitch to your TA and the rest of your project group. Think of the dry run as a “checkpoint” for your final elevator pitch – it doesn’t need to be polished at this stage. You will present your dry run at your Week 8/9 TA check-in; we’ll make an announcement on Piazza once you can sign up for these.
    Then, you’ll individually record a video of you presenting your elevator pitch to YouTube and submit a link to it on Gradescope. There should be no slides in the video, just your face talking. (Let the instructor know if you have any concerns with this requirement.)

Note that every member of your group will have to record separate videos, even if you write your pitches together and they are largely similar.

Unlike the written proposal and schedule, your elevator pitch will be graded by your TA. Each of the six bullet points below are worth 1 point.

    Style: Between 2 and 3 minutes long and clear, and is not too rushed or too basic.
    Style: Not overly scripted, though reading off of notes a little is fine.
    Setup: Introduces the problem area to a general audience.
    Setup: Explains why the area is interesting to a general audience.
    Approach: Describes the specific problem being approached.
    Approach: Describes how the problem will be approached and how to measure success.

To assign a grade to your elevator pitch, your TA will use the following scheme:
Letter Grade	Points
A	4
B	3
C	2
F	0

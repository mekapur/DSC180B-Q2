To that end, please identify all client machines that are sending more data than they are receiving, utilizing the 'OS:NETWORK INTERFACE::BYTES RECEIVED/SEC::' and 'OS:NETWORK INTERFACE::BYTES SENT/SEC::' metrics in the reporting_system_network_consumption table. Note that to calculate sum total of bytes received and sent, you will have to multiple those metrics by the nrs column and by 5 to produce a data volume. Join the guids discovered to the sysinfo data to identify os, chassis, and vendor of the client systems meeting this criteria.",
